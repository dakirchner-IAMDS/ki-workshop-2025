## Create a DSL Language

In this project, I would like to create a domain-specific expression language. Let's start by implementing a lexer, a parser, and an evaluator for an expression language with the follow requirements:

* int literals
* positive and negative values
* +, -, /, *
* Support for braces
* Typical precedence rules

What do you think about these requirements? Are the logically correct and meaningful?
